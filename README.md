The goal of this project is to reveal which G League performance statistics are indicative of success in the NBA. It accomplishes this task using a Decision Tree Classifier to plot the path of successful players. Since success is not easily defined, we define success as any former G League player who is active in the NBA three years later. 2018-2019 G League player performance data were joined with the 2021-2022 NBA season roster to create a dataframe with an indicator variable for active vs inactive players (i.e. 1 or 0).
